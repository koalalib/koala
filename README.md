KOALA is a library of C++ templates, implementing a broad set of procedures in the fields of algorithmic graph theory and network problems in discrete optimization. In its construction, KOALA is based on paradigms of object-oriented programming and generic programming. The base project assumptions are:
<li>versatility of the library - its procedures are adapted to a broad range of various thematic areas of graph algorithmics</li>
<li>interface procedures, which are convenient and friendly for the user.</li>
Thanks to that, KOALA reconciles two apparently contradictory priorities: the created code uses (and also allows the user to use) progressive, advanced C++ language mechanisms, at the same time allowing the programmer to use KOALA codes, knowing object C++ and templates only in a basic range.
